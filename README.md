## 📌 Purpose

This repository aims to help security researchers, students, and defenders:

- Identify Belgian government domains potentially in scope for responsible vulnerability disclosure  
- Reduce guesswork when determining whether a domain may fall under the CCB VDP  
- Encourage coordinated, ethical security research

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimer

- **This list is NOT conclusive** and does not represent a complete or authoritative inventory.  
- **Not every listed domain is guaranteed to resolve** — some domains may be deprecated, inactive, or internal-only.  
- Inclusion in this list **does not automatically confirm scope** for a specific program or assessment.  
- Do not submit domains from these institutions: SGRS/ADIV, VSSE, OCAM/OCAD, Ministry of Defence, police services, Belgian diplomatic and consular missions outside the EU, Class I nuclear establishments, NCCN and judicial authorities.
