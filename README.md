## 🎯 Purpose

This repository helps security researchers and defenders to identify Belgian government–related domains and reduce guesswork when assessing potential VDP scope.

This list is **not authoritative or complete**.  
Always verify scope using official CCB documentation.

The domains dont always resolve or give a 404, this is merely meant as a collection of domains.
